# Go MCP GraphQL Library

A Go library that introspects a GraphQL server and automatically generates MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools, allowing the MCP server to be hosted via HTTP.

## What is this?

This library bridges GraphQL APIs with AI chat sessions by creating an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes GraphQL operations as tools that AI assistants can use.

### The MCP Server
The **MCP Server** acts as a bridge between AI chat sessions and your GraphQL API. It:
- Connects to any GraphQL server (like GitHub's API, your company's API, etc.)
- Automatically discovers all available queries and mutations through introspection
- Converts each GraphQL operation into an MCP "tool" that AI assistants can call
- Runs as an HTTP server that AI clients can connect to
- Handles authentication, parameter validation, and response formatting

### The MCP Client
The **MCP Client** is what AI assistants use to interact with your GraphQL API. It:
- Connects to the MCP server via HTTP
- Lists all available GraphQL operations as tools
- Calls specific tools (GraphQL queries/mutations) with parameters
- Receives structured responses that the AI can understand and work with

**When is the MCP Client used?**
The MCP Client is used by AI assistants (like Claude, ChatGPT, or other MCP-compatible tools) when they need to:
- **Query data**: "Show me all users", "Get the latest posts", "Find products by category"
- **Create resources**: "Create a new user", "Add a blog post", "Update a record"
- **Modify data**: "Update user profile", "Delete old records", "Change settings"
- **Analyze information**: "Summarize user activity", "Generate reports", "Find patterns"

The AI assistant automatically determines which GraphQL operations to call based on the user's natural language request, then uses the MCP Client to execute those operations against your GraphQL API.

### How it works in practice
1. **You** run the MCP server pointing to your GraphQL API
2. **AI assistants** (like Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) connect to your MCP server
3. **Users** can ask the AI to "get all users" or "create a new post" 
4. **The AI** automatically calls the right GraphQL operations through the MCP tools
5. **Your GraphQL API** receives the requests and returns data
6. **The AI** presents the results to the user in a conversational way

## Features

#### ðŸ”§ **Union Type Support**

The library provides comprehensive support for GraphQL union types:

**Automatic Union Detection**
- Introspects union types and their possible member types
- Generates proper inline fragments for each union member
- Handles field conflicts between union member types with automatic aliasing

**Query Generation for Unions**
```graphql
query {
  equipmentNotifications {
    __typename
    ... on EquipmentAlert {
      id
      description
      EquipmentAlert_type: type
      EquipmentAlert_severity: severity
    }
    ... on MaintenanceReminder {
      id
      description
      MaintenanceReminder_type: type
      MaintenanceReminder_priority: priority
    }
    ... on StatusUpdate {
      id
      description
      newStatus
      changedAt
    }
    ... on PerformanceAlert {
      id
      description
      metricType
      currentValue
      expectedValue
    }
  }
}
```

**Union-Specific Methods**
- `GetUnions()` - Returns all union types in the schema
- `GetUnionPossibleTypes(unionName)` - Gets possible types for a union
- `IsUnionType(typeName)` - Checks if a type is a union
- `GetUnionByName(unionName)` - Gets a specific union by name

#### ðŸ”§ **Interface Type Support**

**Automatic Interface Handling**
- Detects interface types and their implementations
- Generates inline fragments for each implementation
- Preserves interface field inheritance

**Query Generation for Interfaces**
```graphql
query {
  personnel {
    __typename
    id
    name
    email
    ... on Manager {
      department
      directReports
      level
    }
    ... on Associate {
      jobTitle
      reportsTo {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

// Create a custom GraphQL client with authentication
client := graphqlmcp.NewGraphQLClient("https://api.example.com/graphql")
client.SetHeader("Authorization", "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN")

// Create MCP server with the authenticated client
server, err := graphqlmcp.NewMCPGraphQLServerWithExecutor(client)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```

### Custom Timeouts

```go
// Create HTTP client with custom timeout
client := &http.Client{
    Timeout: 60 * time.Second,
}

// Use with HTTPMCPClient
mcpClient := graphqlmcp.CreateHTTPClient("http://localhost:8081")
// Note: HTTPMCPClient uses a 30-second default timeout
```

curl http://localhost:8081/tools

# Test a query tool
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "query_posts", "arguments": {}}}'

# Test a mutation tool
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "mutation_createUser", "arguments": {"input": {"name": "Test User", "email": "test@example.com"}}}}'
```

### Testing Union and Interface Features

The example schema includes advanced GraphQL features that you can test:

**Union Type Query**
```bash
# Test the equipmentNotifications union query
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "query { equipmentNotifications { __typename ... on EquipmentAlert { id description severity } ... on MaintenanceReminder { id description type priority } ... on StatusUpdate { id description previousStatus newStatus } ... on PerformanceAlert { id description metricType currentValue expectedValue } } }"}'
```

**Interface Type Query**
```bash
# Test the personnel interface query
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "query { personnel { __typename id name email ... on Manager { department directReports level } ... on Associate { jobTitle reportsTo { id name } } } }"}'
```

**Schema Introspection**
```bash
# View the complete schema with all features
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "query IntrospectionQuery { __schema { types { name kind description possibleTypes { name kind description } } } }"}'
```

## Development Tools

This project follows modern Go patterns for managing build tools and development dependencies:

### Tools Management
- **go.mod**: Contains all tool dependencies with proper versioning
- **Makefile**: Provides convenient commands for all development tasks

### Available Tools
- **Code Generation**: gqlgen for GraphQL code generation
- **Testing**: testify for testing framework
- **Formatting**: gofmt for code formatting

### Quick Development Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
make install

# Format and check code quality
make format
make lint

# Run tests
make test
```

## How It Works

1. **Introspection**: The library performs GraphQL introspection to understand the server's schema
2. **Tool Generation**: Each GraphQL query and mutation becomes an MCP tool
3. **Type Mapping**: GraphQL types are mapped to JSON Schema types for MCP tools
4. **HTTP Wrapper**: The MCP server is wrapped with HTTP transport for web access
